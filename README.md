## What is ClipboardSpace?

ClipboardSpace is an infinite, offline-first workspace where everything you copy lives in one visual space. Paste text, links or images and organize them freely on an endless space.

Think of it as a clipboard manager reimagined as a visual workspace — like Excalidraw, but for everything you copy.
